            <p class="text-md text-justify content-text-size ">Injection is a procedure of pumping cement-based,
                polyurethane-based, epoxy-based or acrylate-based material into damaged or cracked structures to
                securely seal leaks, repair compromised structures and make them watertight again for the long term.

            <p class="content-text-size  text-justify">Injection waterproofing represents a sophisticated
                approach to combating water infiltration in concrete structures. Unlike traditional methods that
                rely on surface coatings or membranes, injection waterproofing penetrates the very heart of the
                structure, addressing vulnerabilities at their source. By injecting specialized waterproofing
                materials directly into cracks, voids, and porous areas, this technique creates a seamless
                barrier that fortifies the structure against water penetration, mitigating the risk of leaks,
                moisture damage, and structural decay.

                        holes about 4 inches deep on one side of the crack or seam and at an angle, so that when the
                        hole crosses the crack, it does so in the center. For example, on an 8-inch-thick wall, we drill
                        so that the hole intersects 4 inches inside the wall. We drill approximately every 5sm from one
                        end of the seam to the other, and then we install injection ports or packers, they can be
                        plastic or metal.</li>
                    <li class="py-2">Then we use a high-pressure pump to pump water and acid, this cleans the injection

                        under pressure. As polyurethane mixes with moisture, inside the wall and in the pores of the
                        material, it begins to expand into foam rubber, and the mixed product (polyurethane foam) begins
                        to penetrate into all pores and voids, expand and seal it. The injection should be performed
                        from one end of the injected surface and continue every 5 sm to the other end. As a result, all
                        voids and weak areas will be filled with polyurethane injection composition from groundwater. If
                        we are talking about a crack in the basement, then its upper part is visible from the outside,
                        and with proper injection, you will see that foam rubber oozes out of it, in fact, the seal
                        passes right through it. This is good protection from groundwater. </li>

            polyurethane resin under pressure through packers hammered into holes drilled in the concrete. The injected
            resin passes through the entire thickness of the foundation wall or slab (usually 8 inches), expands, and
            solidifies in the cavity, thereby eliminating cavities and voids, and preventing water from entering your
            basement. The polyurethane injection waterproofing system is the introduction of a compound into concrete,
            by drilling and injection under pressure, of a double-component polyurethane resin using specialized
            equipment, thus filling voids and cavities inside. It is a safe and environmentally friendly solution to
            stop the penetration of water through foundations, basements, elevator shafts, walls, and concrete joints.
