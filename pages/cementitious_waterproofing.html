            <p class="text-md text-justify content-text-size ">Cementitious waterproofing is a specialized technique
                that involves the application of cement-based coatings or admixtures to concrete surfaces. This process
                creates a waterproof barrier, preventing water penetration and safeguarding structures against the
                damaging effects of moisture, chemicals, and environmental factors. It is the most common method for
                waterproofing. Its main component is cement, sand, and liquid, some may spend extra to add acrylic
                addictive membrane to get better bonding and durability. It Is a semi-flexible waterproofing system that
                uses a mixture of cement and other materials to provide the waterproofing characteristics. It provides a
                good bonding to the structure to protect against water infiltration to seal against damp soil and
                seepage. This waterproofing membrane does not stretch since it is made of cement. This membrane usually
                requires 2-3layer of coating to enhance the waterproofing protection to the concrete surfaces.
                Cementitious waterproofing membrane is easy to apply with a trowel, brush, roller or even spray method.
                This method is often used in internal wet areas, it is a rigid, semi flexible type of waterproofing.
                Since it is commonly used in internal more often, it is not exposed to sunlight and weathering, thus it
                does not go through contract and expansion process. Cementitious waterproofing is a method used to
                protect structures from water penetration by applying a cement-based coating or material. It is commonly
                used in construction to make surfaces such as concrete walls, basements, and foundations impermeable to
                water.</p>

            <h1></h1>
            <p class="content-text-size pt-4 text-justify">Cementitious waterproofing works by creating a durable, water-resistant barrier on concrete surfaces, preventing the infiltration of water and protecting structures from the damaging effects of moisture. The process involves the use of cement-based coatings or admixtures, which work in various ways to enhance the waterproofing properties of the concrete. The process of cementitious waterproofing involves the application of a cement-based mixture that forms a waterproof barrier when cured. This mixture is often composed of Portland cement, sand, and chemical additives that enhance its waterproofing properties. The application can be done using brushes, trowels, or sprayers.</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="list-disc content-text-size">
            <li class="py-2 text-lg font-black ">Coatings and Sealants:
                <p class="content-text-size  text-justify">Cementitious waterproofing coatings are applied directly to the surface of concrete. These coatings typically consist of a mixture of Portland cement, various additives, and polymers. When applied, the coating forms a protective layer that adheres to the concrete substrate, creating a seamless and waterproof surface.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li class="py-2 text-lg font-black">Integral Admixtures: 
                <p class="content-text-size text-justify">Integral waterproofing involves adding specialized admixtures directly into the concrete mix during the mixing process. These admixtures may include hydrophobic agents, crystalline compounds, or other waterproofing chemicals. As the concrete cures, these additives create a network of water-repelling compounds within the concrete matrix, enhancing its resistance to water penetration.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="py-2 text-lg font-black">Capillary Blocking:
                <p class="content-text-size text-justify">One key mechanism in cementitious waterproofing is the ability to block capillaries and pores within the concrete. Water can seep into concrete through capillaries and microscopic pores. The cementitious materials work to fill and seal these openings, preventing water molecules from passing through and ensuring a watertight barrier.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="py-2 text-lg font-black">Chemical Reaction:
                <p class="content-text-size  text-justify">Some cementitious waterproofing systems rely on chemical reactions to enhance waterproofing. For example, crystalline waterproofing agents react with moisture in the concrete to form insoluble crystals. These crystals fill voids and microcracks, creating an impermeable barrier that hinders water penetration over time.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="py-2 text-lg font-black">Flexible and Elastomeric Properties:
                <p class="content-text-size  text-justify">Certain cementitious waterproofing products exhibit flexible and elastomeric properties. This flexibility allows the material to withstand minor movements in the structure without cracking or losing its waterproofing effectiveness. It is particularly important in areas prone to structural settling or thermal expansion and contraction.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="py-2 text-lg font-black">Resistance to Environmental Factors:
                <p class="content-text-size  text-justify">Cementitious waterproofing is designed to withstand various environmental factors, including UV exposure, temperature fluctuations, and chemical exposure. This resilience ensures that the waterproofing system remains effective over the long term, providing continuous protection against water damage.</p>
