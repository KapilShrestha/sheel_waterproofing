            <p class="text-md text-justify content-text-size ">Roof waterproofing is the process of protecting a
                building's roof from water damage by applying materials that prevent water from penetrating the roof
                surface.
                Various waterproofing materials, such as asphalt coatings, liquid-applied membranes, and pre-formed
                sheet membranes, can be applied to existing or new structures, creating a barrier that prevents water
                from seeping into the building. Additionally, it will support the reduction of heat that is absorbed by
                the roof.
                When choosing a roof waterproofing option, it is important to consider different factors such as the
                climate, type of roof, expected life span, and the intended use of the building.
